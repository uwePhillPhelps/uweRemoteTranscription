Remote Transcription

What is it?
This is application is based on the BIT Remote Access.app.
It is written using a combination of  applescripts and shell scripts. It's main function is to provide a graphical launcher/frontend for various tasks:

	* setup ssh tunnel(s) to the transcription server (a mac mini, connected to ranger, behind the uwe ras)
	* launch Screen Sharing and AudioLab (for remote interaction with the server transcription software)
	* setup AFP sessions (for uploading audio to the server Dropbox)
	* connect to web "processing" interface (for managing uploaded audio files)

Requirements
BIT Remote Access should work on any Macintosh (PPC or Intel) running a version of OS X later than 10.4.x

The application depends on /usr/bin/bash for shell scripting
also /usr/bin/ssh  and /usr/bin/expect  for remote tunneling,
also /System/Library/CoreServices/Screen Sharing.app  for remote control the server keyboard/mouse,
also /System/Library/Components/CoreAudio.component and /System/Developer/Applications/Audio/Audio Lab.app for remote listening of audio generated by the server.

This application tries to search for these dependencies but if they have been corrupted or deleted, or their APIs have changed significantly since this application was written (in 2011) then problems will occur.

How do I use it?

There is no installation process, simply copy .app file to your Applications folder
(It will actually run from anywhere on your machine although we recommend the applications folder)

1. Double Click to Run.

2. Choose connection type "internal" or "external" (i.e. on campus -vs- at home)
	2a. If external, enter your BIT username and password in the fields provided

3. Click connect, watch the status line for updates (stage 1/2, stage 2/2 etc) and errors

	If connection is successful; AULab and ScreenSharing should automatically start.
	
	These applications will allow remote control of the server transcription software (when audio has been uploaded & segmented).
	In the beginning we need to ignore the remote control applications; we need to upload/process audio - skip to step 4a.
	
	ScreenSharing requires manual authentication
		enter username:
		enter password: 

	AULab requires manual connection
		Click the "local forward" entry in the lower panel labelled "Directory"
			the entry will change colour when selected
			click the "select host" button to be sure
		Click the "connect" button in the top panel
			the status will change to "connected" when successful

	You can minimise these windows if desired

4. To upload new audio; click the "dropbox" button
	enter username:
	enter password: 

5. To prepare newly uploaded audio for transcription; click the "PHP Processing" button
	your webbrowser should open an HTTP connection to a page generated by the server
	follow the instructions on the website to add a description, and segment the audio before transcription begins

The optional Reset button will close any existing tunnels to the Remote Access Server, initialise the username and password fields and run a brief network test to establish the state of your network.
